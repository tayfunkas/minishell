How our progran works:
1. execute program "minishell"
2. parse arguments based on token
3. Assign datas(str, type..) in the struct "t_token"
4. Check if tokens include A.pipe(|), B.redirection(>. >>. <), C.external command, D.internal command
5. Handle tokens according to the result of 4.

- splited functions into each '.c' file properly according to each step
- After parsing arguments, our program go to "handle_tokens" function.
- In handle_tokens function, I developed
	1. function "is_external_command" and "is_internal_command"
	2. function "execute_external_command" and "find_cmd_path"
		Now it handles external command with only one word, like "pwd" "ls"
		But it still doesn't work with over a word, like "ls -l". (to be followed-up tomorrow)
Sep 27th
- included all internal commands
- cd, env, exit, pwd works. echo will be checked.
- unset and export will be checked.
- handle_tokens function has been updated.
