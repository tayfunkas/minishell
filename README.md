# minishell

**Minishell** is a minimalistic shell implementation created as part of the 42 programming school curriculum. This project aims to provide a deep understanding of Unix shell behavior by building a functional shell from scratch. The shell supports command execution, environment variable management, and pipeline operations, mimicking the behavior of Bash.

This project was developed collaboratively by **[Tayfunkas](https://github.com/tayfunkas)** and **[kyla-kang](https://github.com/kyla-kang)**, highlighting the importance of teamwork and shared problem-solving in software development.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

- **Command Execution**: Execute binary commands from paths defined in the `PATH` environment variable.
- **Built-in Commands**: Implementation of essential shell built-in commands such as `echo`, `cd`, `pwd`, `export`, `unset`, `env`, and `exit`.
- **Pipelines**: Support for command pipelines (`|`) to connect the output of one command to the input of another.
- **Redirections**: Input (`<`), output (`>`), and append (`>>`) redirection capabilities.
- **Signal Handling**: Graceful handling of signals like `Ctrl+C`, `Ctrl+D`, and `Ctrl+\`, ensuring a user-friendly experience.
- **Environment Variables**: Management and expansion of environment variables.
- **Error Handling**: Proper handling and display of error messages to mimic Bash-like behavior.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

- **System Programming**: Deep dive into system calls such as `fork`, `exec`, `pipe`, and `dup2`.
- **Process Management**: Creating, managing, and synchronizing child processes.
- **Shell Behavior**: Understanding and implementing the core functionality of a Unix shell.
- **Team Collaboration**: Working effectively with a partner to design, implement, and debug a complex program.
